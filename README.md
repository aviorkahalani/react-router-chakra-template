# React Router Chakra Template

A production-ready starter template for **React Router v7 framework mode** with **Chakra UI**, designed for server-side rendering (SSR), proper hydration, and scalable application architecture.

This template provides a clean and opinionated setup that solves the common integration challenges between React Router’s framework mode and Chakra UI, including layout composition, provider wiring, and hydration-safe theming.

## Why this template?

React Router v7 framework mode introduces a powerful, file-based routing and SSR model, but integrating UI libraries like Chakra UI requires careful setup to avoid hydration mismatches and layout pitfalls. This repository exists to give you a solid, battle-tested starting point.

Out of the box, it includes:

- A correct **root document layout** (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`) for framework mode
- Chakra UI properly configured for **SSR and hydration**
- A clean separation between **route modules**, **layouts**, and **UI components**
- Sensible defaults that follow React Router and Chakra UI best practices

## What’s included

- ⚡ React Router v7 (framework mode)
- 🎨 Chakra UI with provider setup
- 🧠 Hydration-safe layout configuration
- 🧱 Scalable folder structure
- 🛠 Ready to extend for auth, data loaders, and actions

## Who is this for?

This template is ideal for:

- Developers adopting **React Router v7 framework mode**
- Teams building **SSR React applications**
- Anyone who wants Chakra UI without spending hours debugging hydration issues
